For the final project of our Ruby and Rails course, four of us created a scavenger hunt app using the Google Maps API. The user can leave geo-located messages for other users. If a user checks in to a location and is within a block of a message left for them then they can read the message. The UI is designed to be mobile friendly and responsive in order to enhance the usability of the app. 

I contributed to many different aspects of the code from database design, to incorporating the Google Maps API into a Rails application.
