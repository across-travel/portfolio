For the final project in Intro to Programming, four of us created a bike share app, using live data from Biketown. Additionally, when the number of bikes at a station changes, the marker changes momentarily.

I implemented the stations list and the selection station in the UI. This was also the first time I had ever learned how to make a promise, which was a pivotal learning moment.
