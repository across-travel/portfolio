This was a an exercise in re-building a site using Angular. This was an attempt to replicate the beautiful [99% invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) invisible site. I chose this site because I love the design, and I felt that the complexity of it would be a good challenge. The small details like audio footer that follows as you scroll through the page and the tasteful hover effects create simple intrigue to the site. The deployed app plays 99% Invisible episodes when the user clicks the 'play'.
